# PCV estimates
There is evidence to suggest that bacterial pneumonia may be contributing to deaths in patients infected with 2019-nCoV. To this end, we wanted to flag that we have spatio-temporal varying estimates of PCV coverage that may facilitate ongoing modeling of this dimension of the outbreak.

Currently, the work is all provisional, and some of the estimates are undergoing peer review or finalization. We are willing to share preliminary estimates however - if you are interested please contact Jon Mosser at jmosser@uw.edu
